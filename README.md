# Memory Piano

A memory game in the style of Simon/Bop It where the player has to remember what notes were played on a piano and play them back. It will get harder as more and more notes have to be remembered.

Created for my Code Institute Interactive Frontend Development milestone project.
 
## UX

### Primary Goals

To create a memory game that is fun for the user and simple to learn, while getting continually more challenging.

### Developer Goals

- To gain experience using JavaScript and jQuery to create interactive user friendly websites.
- To create a game I will enjoy playing.

### User Stories

As a player of the game I want:

1. Clear and simple instructions on the rules of the game so I am not confused about how to play.
2. An intuitive UI so I can easily play the game.
3. Continually increasing difficulty so I do not get bored with the game quickly.
4. A rolling high score to track my progress and give me something to aim for.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

- Modal when page opened explaining the rules of the memory game
- Piano feature on screen which will play notes and you can play back to.
- Rolling score and high scores on screen.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#:~:text=Hypertext%20Markup%20Language%20(HTML)%20is,scripting%20languages%20such%20as%20JavaScript.)
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
- [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
